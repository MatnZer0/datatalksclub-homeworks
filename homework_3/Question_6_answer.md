Question 6. Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?

Answer: GCP Bucket

"An external data source is a data source that you can query directly from BigQuery, even though the data is not stored in BigQuery storage. For example, you might have data in a different Google Cloud database, in files in Cloud Storage, or in a different cloud product altogether that you would like to analyze in BigQuery, but that you aren't prepared to migrate."
